"# ADSP_Course_2_project" 

This repo contains all the files for the final assignment of the course https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting
The project is aimed at answering the following question:
How has every contry dominated UEFA Champions League (aka European Cup) over the years?

Some web scraping is performed to get the best 8 teams in the knockout phase for every season.
Every team that reached that phase given a score according to their performance, as shown in the season's bracket:
4 - Winner, 3 - Final, 2 - Semi-final, 1 - Quarter-finals

Data is saved in a csv file for visualisation purposes, and then retrived to show the global performance of every contry (with the data groupped) over the 1955-2022 period
