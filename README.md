"# ADSP_Course_2_project" 

This repo contains all the files for the final assignment of the course https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting
The project is aimed at answering the following question:
How has every contry dominated UEFA Champions League (aka European Cup) over the years?

Some web scraping is performed to get all the teams in the knockout phase for every season.
Every team that reached that phase given a score according to their performance, as shown in the seaon's bracket:
5 - Winner, 4 - Final, 3 - Semi-final, 2 - Quarter-finals, 1 - Round of 16

Data is saved in a csv file for visualisation purposes, and then retrived to show the global performance of every contry (with the data groupped) over the 1955-2022 period
